## 🚧 The Problem

India's platform-based delivery partners — Zomato, Swiggy, Zepto, Amazon, Dunzo — are the **backbone of our fast-paced digital economy**. However, external disruptions such as extreme weather, pollution, and natural disasters can reduce their working hours and cause them to **lose 20–30% of their monthly earnings**.

Currently, gig workers have **zero income protection** against these uncontrollable events. When disruptions occur, they bear the full financial loss with no safety net.

| Reality | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Daily income loss per disruption | ₹300 – ₹800 |
| Monthly income at risk | 20–30% |
| Available insurance products | **Zero** |
| Compensation from platform | **None** |
| Backup savings buffer | Near zero |

> **The invisible risk zone:** Severe weather · Heavy pollution · Curfews & lockdowns · Road blockages — *No work. No pay. No safety net.*

## 👤 Persona — Ravi, Food Delivery Partner

### Who is Ravi?

```
Name        : Ravi
Age         : 26
City        : Chennai
Platform    : Swiggy / Zomato
Work Style  : 8–10 hours/day
Daily Income: ₹500–₹800 (order-dependent)
Savings     : Near zero — dependent on weekly earnings for rent, groceries, EMI
Insurance   : None — never had access to any income protection
```

### 🎬 Scenario: "A Day When Everything Goes Wrong"

> Ravi logs in at 1:00 PM, expecting a busy lunch shift.

**Normal start of day:**
- 📦 Orders start coming in steadily
- 💰 Earnings building — on track for ₹600/day
- ⚡ **Suddenly — heavy rain starts (94mm rainfall in 3 hours, IMD Red Alert issued)**

**Within minutes:**
- 🌧️ Roads get flooded across Chennai zones
- ❌ Active orders get cancelled by customers
- 🚫 New orders stop arriving entirely
- 👉 Ravi is forced to log out

**The Damage:**
- Lost 3–4 hours of peak earning time
- Lost ₹300–₹500 income — 50–60% of a full day's earnings
- No compensation from platform or government
- Rent, groceries, and EMI obligations remain unchanged

> *"Ravi didn't stop working — the environment stopped him."*

**With Income Shield AI:**
> IMD Red Alert triggers automatically. Income deviation computed against Ravi's 30-day baseline. Fraud engine validates in under 45 seconds. ₹420 credited to his UPI. WhatsApp received: *"₹420 payout credited — stay safe, Ravi."*

### Phase-by-Phase Detail

**Phase 1 — Onboarding:** Handles KYC via Aadhaar OTP + DigiLocker, AI-driven risk scoring, and NLP-guided coverage selection so workers understand exactly what they're buying.

**Phase 2 — Policy Config:** AI defines precise trigger thresholds (e.g. rainfall ≥ 94mm in 3hrs, AQI ≥ 300), dynamically prices the premium using historical data, and runs back-test simulations showing what payouts would have looked like in past events.

**Phase 3 — Issuance:** Encodes policy terms into a smart contract or signed digital ledger, eliminating ambiguity at claim time.

**Phase 4 — Monitoring:** Data oracles (weather APIs, AQI feeds, civic disruption data) stream into an ML anomaly detection engine that watches for threshold breaches 24/7.

**Phase 5 — Claims:** Fully automated. Trigger fires → system self-files the claim → cross-validates oracle data from multiple sources → fraud check → computes income deviation payout. No action needed from the worker.

**Phase 6 — Payout:** Funds delivered within minutes. Full audit trail surfaces exactly why a payout was (or wasn't) triggered, maintaining complete trust.

## ⚡ Parametric Triggers

All triggers are hyperlocal — validated at the worker's specific delivery zone, not city-wide alerts.

| # | Trigger | Data Source | Threshold | Notes |
|---|---------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| 🌧️ 1 | **Heavy Rain / Floods** | IMD + OpenWeatherMap | Rainfall ≥ 94mm in 3hrs / Red Alert issued | Core Chennai/Mumbai monsoon risk |
| 🌡️ 2 | **Extreme Heat** | IMD + Open-Meteo | Temperature ≥ 43°C or official advisory | Summer months, outdoor suspension |
| 🌫️ 3 | **High Pollution (AQI)** | CPCB AQI Feeds + OpenAQ | AQI ≥ 300 (Hazardous) | Delhi, Bengaluru Diwali season |
| 🚧 4 | **Curfew / Lockdown** | Civic Disruption APIs | Section 144 or mobility index < 20% | Political events, protests |
| 🌊 5 | **Road Blockage / Floods** | Traffic API + IMD | Zone roads impassable > 2hrs | Flood-zone specific routing |

### Income Deviation Formula

```
Actual Payout = (30-Day Baseline Daily Income) × (Hours Lost / Normal Active Hours) × Severity Factor

Where:
  30-Day Baseline = Rolling average of worker's actual daily earnings (last 30 days)
  Hours Lost      = Active working hours disrupted (platform-verified)
  Severity Factor = 0.5–1.0 based on disruption intensity

Example — Ravi, Chennai Flood:
  Baseline daily income : ₹700
  Hours lost            : 4 hrs out of 8hr shift (50%)
  Severity factor       : 0.90 (Red Alert = extreme)
  Payout = ₹700 × 0.50 × 0.90 = ₹315 → rounded to ₹320 credited via UPI
```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 1. Predictive Risk Model

The system predicts disruption probability and dynamically prices each worker's weekly premium using:

- Zone-specific flood/heat/AQI historical data (IMD + CPCB, 2019–2024)
- Seasonal disruption patterns (monsoon multipliers, Diwali AQI spikes)
- Worker platform tenure and active hours consistency
- Location risk index (flood-prone zones, high-pollution corridors)

### 2. Behavioral Fraud Detection (Isolation Forest)

Detects anomalies using a **30-day rolling behavioral baseline** per worker:

| Fraud Vector | Detection Method |
|---|---|
| GPS spoofing | Device authentication + IP check + cell tower triangulation |
| Impossible location shifts | Geospatial velocity check (>50km/hr = flag) |
| Fake disruption claims | Multi-source oracle cross-validation (3 independent APIs) |
| Abnormal claim frequency | Velocity rule: max 2 claims per 7-day window before review |
| Income inflation | Cross-check declared income vs. platform-reported 30-day baseline |
| Inconsistent activity patterns | Isolation Forest anomaly score on behavioral time-series |

### 3. Real-Time Income Deviation Engine

Unlike traditional parametric insurance (which pays a fixed amount per event), Income Shield AI computes **exact income deviation** against each worker's personal baseline:

- Workers with higher baselines get proportionally higher payouts
- Workers who were not actively logged in at disruption time receive reduced payouts
- Partial disruptions (2 hours out of 8) get partial payouts — not binary full/nothing

## 💰 Weekly Premium Model

### Pricing Philosophy

> "Earn weekly. Pay weekly. Stay protected weekly."

Our pricing model is designed specifically for gig workers whose income is **short-term, variable, and location-dependent**. Instead of monthly or yearly plans, we use a dynamic weekly premium that adapts to real-time risk, remains affordable, and aligns with weekly earning cycles.

### AI-Based Pricing Formula

```
Weekly Premium = Base Rate + (Location Risk Index × 0.35) + (Disruption Probability × Coverage Amount × 0.08)

Components:
  Base Rate             = Standard minimum coverage cost (₹20 baseline)
  Location Risk Index   = Area-specific risk score (0.0–1.0)
                          Flood-prone zones · High AQI corridors · Traffic congestion
  Disruption Probability = AI-predicted probability for next 7 days
                          Using weather forecasts + historical data + seasonal patterns

Example — Ravi, Chennai, Monsoon Season:
  Base Rate        = ₹20
  Location Index   = 0.72 (flood-prone zone)
  Disruption Prob  = 0.45
  Coverage Amount  = ₹3,000

  Weekly Premium   = ₹20 + (0.72 × 0.35 × 100) + (0.45 × ₹3,000 × 0.08)
                   = ₹20 + ₹25.20 + ₹108
                   = ₹153.20 / week  (~5% of weekly income)
```

### Premium Tiers (Indicative)

| Zone Risk | Location Type | Weekly Premium | Weekly Coverage | % of Income |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🟢 Low | Stable zone, low disruption history | ₹29/week | ₹1,800/week | ~1.1% |
| 🟡 Moderate | Seasonal exposure, some disruption risk | ₹49/week | ₹3,000/week | ~1.4% |
| 🔴 High | Flood-prone / AQI zone / bandh-frequent | ₹79/week | ₹5,000/week | ~1.8% |

> Premiums are **recalculated every Monday** using fresh AI inference — zone risk, seasonal forecast, worker tenure, and 30-day earning history.

---

## 🛡️ Adversarial Defense & Anti-Spoofing

Income Shield AI uses a **multi-layer validation architecture** to protect against GPS spoofing, fake data injection, and manipulation attempts.

### Defense Layers

```
LAYER 1 — DEVICE AUTHENTICATION
  Device fingerprint · App attestation · Jailbreak/root detection

LAYER 2 — LOCATION VERIFICATION
  GPS coordinates + Cell tower triangulation + IP geolocation
  Velocity check: location shift > 50km/hr = impossible movement flag

LAYER 3 — DATA ORACLE CROSS-VALIDATION
  3 independent API sources must agree on disruption event
  IMD + OpenWeatherMap + CPCB must all confirm before trigger fires

LAYER 4 — BEHAVIORAL ANOMALY DETECTION
  Isolation Forest on 30-day rolling baseline
  Flags: unusual claim velocity, income deviation outliers

LAYER 5 — AUDIT TRAIL
  All trigger decisions logged immutably
  Workers see exactly why a payout was or was not issued
  Insurer dashboard shows full SHAP explainability
```

### Anti-Spoofing Strategy

- Suspicious claims are **blocked or delayed** until multi-source validation completes
- Workers can see exactly why their claim was held — full transparency
- Behavioral monitoring continues across rolling windows — patterns identified over time, not just per-event
- All actions stored in immutable secure audit logs for regulatory compliance

---

## 🌐 Platform Choice — Web PWA

### Why Web Application, Not Mobile-First?

| Factor | Decision | Reason |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Accessibility** | React PWA | Works on all devices via browser — no app install required |
| **Low-end devices** | PWA | Runs on ₹6,000 Android phones with 2GB RAM |
| **Offline access** | Service Worker | Policy status and alert history accessible offline |
| **Deployment speed** | Web | Instant updates — no app store approval delays |
| **Development cost** | Single codebase | React PWA covers Android + iOS + Desktop (~60% cost saving) |
| **AI integration** | Backend-driven | Real-time risk prediction + live parametric trigger execution |
| **Real-time processing** | WebSockets + REST | 24/7 environmental monitoring + instant claim triggering |
| **Security** | Centralized | Aadhaar OTP + DigiLocker KYC, immutable audit logging |
| **Hackathon fit** | React + FastAPI | Faster to build, easier to demonstrate end-to-end in 6 weeks |

## 🔴 What Income Shield AI Strictly Excludes

The problem statement has a hard constraint — we never touch these:

| ❌ Excluded | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| Vehicle repairs or maintenance | Personal mechanical failure — not an external parametric trigger |
| Health or medical expenses | Out of coverage scope |
| Life or accident insurance | Separate regulated product category |
| Platform commission changes | Business policy decision, not an environmental disruption |
| Worker's voluntary absence | Personal choice — not an uncontrollable external event |

The system only pays when an **external, measurable, zone-level event** causes income loss that the worker had absolutely no control over.

## 🌟 Why Income Shield AI Wins

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Income Deviation Model** | Unlike fixed-amount parametric insurance, we compute exact personal income loss against each worker's 30-day baseline — Ravi gets paid for what *he* actually lost |
| **Hyperlocal Triggers** | Zone-level polygon validation — not city-wide alerts. Ravi's Adyar zone must actually be affected |
| **30-Day Rolling Baseline** | Fraud engine learns each worker's normal behavior — unusual patterns over time, not just per-event anomalies |
| **Dual-Layer AI** | Predictive risk pricing + behavioral fraud detection running simultaneously |
| **Multi-Source Oracle** | 3 independent APIs must agree before a trigger fires — eliminates single-point-of-failure false payouts |
| **Immutable Audit Trail** | Every trigger decision logged with full SHAP explainability — workers see exactly why payout was or wasn't issued |
| **Monday Auto-Renewal** | Weekly premium aligns perfectly with Swiggy/Zomato payment cycles — zero friction |
